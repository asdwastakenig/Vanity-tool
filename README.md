# Vanity (Cyanide Fork)
Cyanide Fork Envy & Spite 1.4.5 project set-up tool.
Edited ver. of AssetRipper: [https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/)
HOW TO USE: -Run Vanity.GUI and follow the instructions. 



## REQUIRES THE .NET SDK 8.0 AT [HERE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Source code of GUID_Corrector that comes prepackaged with releases (and is required for Vanity to run properly): https://github.com/ImNotSimon/Vanity-GUIDcorrector 

Note: Vanity, to run properly and as intended from compiled source, needs to have the "AssetRipper.Settings.json" file found in the root directory of this repository alongside "Vanity.GUI.exe" due to how AssetRipper works in terms of settings.

## THIS IS PERSONAL, DO NOT REALLY USE THIS, I WILL COMPILE IT THO. CYA!
