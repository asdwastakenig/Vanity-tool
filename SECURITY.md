## Supported Versions

Alright, here’s the rundown of which versions are getting the love and which ones... not so much. Some of these are a bit more temperamental than others, so please be patient. I'll try to keep it updated, but hey, life happens.

Also Checkmark means yes.
X means no(obviously yall)
and the square thingy.. is a ... maybe?

| Version         | Supported           |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Newest          | :white_check_mark:  |
| Prototypes      | :x:                 |
| Tester Beta     | :white_check_mark:  |
| CLOSED REP      | :x:                 |
| LTS             | :white_check_mark:  |
| STS             | :x:                 |
| Seasonal        | :x:                 |
| Random Fucks    | :white_check_mark:  |
| Ports           | :black_square_button: |

Got it? Cool. If you're using something that’s not "Newest" or "Tester Beta," you might be on your own, buddy. But hey, I’ll try my best.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

So, you found a vulnerability? Awesome! (Well, not awesome, but you know what I mean.) If you spot a bug or security issue, please let me know so I can fix it. Here’s how we can make this work:

### How to Report a Vulnerability (With Osaka)

Hello, dear coder or other user!  
First off, big thanks for being on the lookout! If you found something that could be dangerous, please hit me up at the right address. I’m here for serious things and casual suggestions, so just choose the correct email.

- For **serious** vulnerabilities: **osaka.serious@gmail.com**
- For **suggestions** or **non-urgent** things: **osaka.unserious@gmail.com**

Keep it respectful, keep it clear, and I’ll work with you to patch it. I promise I’m not a robot (unless you count my inbox, which might be a little too good at filtering out spam).

### What to Include in the Report

So you’ve found something? Great. Here’s what I need to know to get to work:

- **Version**: Which version were you using when this happened? Let’s keep things precise!
- **Are you using Wine?** (Linux folks, this one's for you!)
- **Report**: Tell me what happened. What’s broken? What’s vulnerable?
- **How to Replicate**: If I can’t replicate it, it’s gonna be hard to fix, right? So, give me the steps.
- **Level of Vulnerability**: Is this an "Oh no, we’re all doomed!" level, or a "Meh, it's a small annoyance" type of bug?

### What You Can Expect

Here’s the deal:  
Once I get your report, here's what happens next:

- A response! It'll be a solid "Yes" or "No" on whether I can do something about it.
- If it’s a legit issue, you’ll get a **re-rated score** for the vulnerability (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- And of course, a sincere thank you from me! I’m nice, **I swear, i didnt bite. yet.**. (legally i have to say i do not condone or bite people okkk???)

### Response Timeline

I’ll try to give you an update/patch **every Saturday** or over the weekend (because weekends are when I’m feeling the most productive). If it’s super urgent, I’ll get to work right away and push a fix to the main branch. It’ll be like magic... but slower.

### Important Notes

- **Spam Filter Alert**: I’ve got a spam filter to keep out the nastiness. To get through, make sure you:
  - Don’t swear (I’m not your mom, but let's keep it professional).
  - Don’t use ProtonMail or any AnonMail (It’s just a thing, okay?).
  - Be polite and kind — I’m all about the positive vibes.

If you follow these, I promise your email will get through. Otherwise, you might get stuck in the spam void... and no one wants that.

Thanks for helping me keep things safe and secure. You’re the best!
